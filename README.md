# Board game cupboard API

This is a project I'm using to learn JAX-RS in Java. It's not a fantastic example of how to design an API.
Code follows the examples from the [Javabrains course](https://javabrains.io/courses/javaee_jaxrs/lessons/Returning-Xml-Response/)

## API
### GET /games
```
[{
    "estimatePlaytimeMinutes": 0,
    "lastAddedDate": "2018-09-07",
    "maxNumberOfPlayers": 0,
    "minNumberOfPlayers": 0,
    "name": "Terraforming Mars",
    "owner": "Mat"
}]
```
